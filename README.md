# Mandelbrot Set C experiment

I've always loved experimenting with basic C programs.

Back in the DOS days, I'd implement plasma screens, weird effects caused by strange formulas, etc.

Today I remembered the beauty of the Mandelbrot Set, and decided to speed up my coding playground using ChatGPT as my helper.

The commits show the history (and speed!) of the changes made
